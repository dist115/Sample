This guide reflects a sample implementation of these requirements and solutions we provided, it is not actual
document as there was independent platform for reporting task and providing guides on how the project workflow.


Project Overview

This guide outlines the solution we implemented to address a client’s need for a group-based, role-specific 
form submission system using a custom WordPress setup.

Project Overview and Client Requirements
The client used a WordPress plugin to create forms and manage user roles, with predefined roles and permissions.
Their challenge was managing group submissions while meeting specific workflow requirements, 
including visibility and edit permissions. The primary requirements were as follows:

Group Submission: Each group of three participants needed a way to submit and manage a shared form.
Role-Based Access and Permissions:

Student Role: Students could only view other members’ submissions once the counselor provided feedback.

Counselor Role: The counselor, who served as an administrator, needed the ability to provide feedback and 
grant permissions to edit or resubmit forms.

Solution and Implementation
To achieve this functionality:

We designed a plugin extension and custom database schema to store and manage group submissions details and feedback.
Our solution leveraged existing plugin functions and extended them to meet the client’s requirements,
ensuring seamless integration. Custom functions allowed the counselor to review, provide feedback, 
and enable form edits for students, creating a controlled, user-friendly workflow.
This tailored setup delivered the intended workflow precisely as the client envisioned, 
enhancing their WordPress-based platform's functionality while maintaining stability and performance.
